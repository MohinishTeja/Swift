#  <a name="built"></a>How I built it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entire DApp frontend is built using mainly JS and HTML. Smart Contracts are written in Solidity and deployed through Polygon network for high scalability. IPFS is used entirely to store all the images and deployed through Fleek platform. NFT's are also minted and stored in IPFS.
